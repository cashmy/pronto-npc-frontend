**_"Where Every Character Has a Story."_**

---

**Pronto NPC Generator** is a web-based application that allows users to randomly create NPC (Non-Player Character) profiles for different gaming systems.  
It is designed to support both **universal systems** (global) and **user-specific custom systems**.

This project uses:

- **Frontend:** React Typescript / ViteJS / Material UI / Custom CSS
- **Backend:** Python / Django
- **Database:** MySQL

## 🎭 Project Philosophy

Unlike traditional "stat block" generators that focus heavily on combat stats, numbers, and game mechanics,  
**NPC Generator** is opinionated toward a **storytelling-first** approach.

The goal is to **enrich world-building** and **deepen character immersion** by focusing on elements like:

- Characteristic traits (personality, quirks)
- Deep wants, needs, and motivations
- Physical appearance (hair, eyes, scars, height, build)
- Gender, age categories, and race/species
- Professions and vocations
- Hometowns, regions, and locations
- Social groupings and cultural classifications

In short:  
> **_"More about who they are, rather than just what they can do."_**

## 🔮 Future Vision

- Expand NPC generation with **modular templates**.
- Allow **user-driven system sharing** (private group visibility).
- Add **AI-assisted character traits** and plot hooks.
- Include **visual avatars** and **symbolic descriptions** using AI imagery or custom uploads.
- Enable **"community systems"** where multiple users collaborate on a custom world.

> Stats may tell you how strong they are.  
> But stories tell you **why** they fight.
